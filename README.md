# Test instructions

The following are the instructions for completing the test.  ***Please read through them all before starting.***

The idea of this test is to see what you can achieve within a small timeframe. We are not expecting all points below to be covered, but to add as much * **business value** * as possible before thinking of fixing / tidying any existing issues.

### Synopsis

 - **The aim of this project is to output some basic statistical data about stock prices**
 - The Object model for the data has been provided
 - A Stocks feed API has been wired up by a junior programmer to provide incoming example data (further information on Stock API given below)

We would like you to spend 3 hours on this Java Spring Boot project which accomplishes the following:
 
 - Retrieve 7 working days worth of historical data for the 20 companies in the list provided in the code (also referenced below)
   - The API only gets data from weekdays, not weekends.
 - Store the data from each stock symbol for each day into a structure that can be queried.
 - Log out to the display at regular intervals (say every minute) the following stats: 
	 - **Stat 1** : The top 10 highest value stocks by `close` value for the previous 7 working days (in order â€“ largest first, then order by company code in the case of a tie in value)
         - Each company should only appear once in the list, so only consider the highest close value for each company for each day.
         - If there is not enough data to show the top 10 list - an appropriate message should be displayed instead.
	 - **Stat 2** : The top 5 companies that have the greatest overall ***positive*** % change percent in stock value over `any 3 day` period for that company. 
		 - These should be listed in % change order, with the highest % change at the top.  Then ordered by stock symbol in the case of a tie.
           - The change should be considered from the earliest `open` value to the latest `close` value.
		- If there is not enough data to show the top 5 list - an appropriate message should be displayed instead.

### Stretch goals 
If you finish the above and wish to continue, then the following are stretch goals:

- Use Lombok to remove as much boilerplate code as possible
- Replace any code you consider bad practice (with comments)
- Add one or more Rest APIs to retrieve the same data sets that are being logged to the console.

### Important!
- Please do make sure you commit your work into the repo at the end of the task, within the 3 hrs!  It is a good idea to commit several times, at various milestones during the task, so the assessor can see the progress as a series of logical stages.
- If you wish to continue coding beyond the 3 hours as you are enjoying it so much, then fine!  
  - But only commits in the first 3 hours will be considered... give or take a few mins :-) to keep it fair for everyone... 
- If you have any comments / feedback / questions on the requirements, then please feel free to add them into this Readme.md file

### Stock API info

- It uses an api service called polygon.io
- This service is severely rate limited - this is expected, do not be surprised by this!
- We call the endpoint [Daily Open/Close](https://polygon.io/docs/stocks/get_v1_open-close__stocksticker___date) passing the stock symbol and date to fetch for
- This returns json like so :

`{
"afterHours": 322.1,
"close": 325.12,
"from": "2023-01-09",
"high": 326.2,
"low": 322.3,
"open": 324.66,
"preMarket": 324.5,
"status": "OK",
"symbol": "AAPL",
"volume": 26122646
}`
